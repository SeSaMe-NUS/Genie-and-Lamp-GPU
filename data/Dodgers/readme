description:
This loop sensor data was collected for the Glendale on ramp for the 101 North freeway in Los Angeles. 
It is close enough to the stadium to see unusual traffic after a Dodgers game,
but not so close and heavily used by game traffic so that the signal for the extra traffic is overly obvious.

The observations were taken over 25 weeks, 288 time slices per day (5 minute count aggregates).
